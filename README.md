## Intro
I think [this guide from Ars](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/04/the-ars-guide-to-building-a-linux-router-from-scratch/) is the best one to understand how to setup a linux router. But the problem was that some of the steps in the guide differs from the way of doing things in Ubuntu 20.04. This document makes reference to the original guide and provide the updated steps for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS(Focal Fossa).
